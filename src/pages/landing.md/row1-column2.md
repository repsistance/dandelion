## Got an idea?

Do you want to build the next [PoolTool][pooltool] or any other **dApp** but can't spend **resources and time** on setting everything up just to make a **PoC** (Proof of Concept)?

No worries, start by exploring our [free APIs][get-started] and think about hosting/scaling later, we might help with that also in the future by offering some paid plans!

Do you think your idea can help on growing Cardano's ecosystem? Then don't forget to participate on [Catalyst][catalyst] project by submiting your idea on [IdeaScale][ideascale], get feedback, iterate on it and who knows, maybe, get DeCentra-funded!
