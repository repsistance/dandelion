# cardano-explorer-api

This is the currently [officially supported API][cardano-rest] to explore Cardano transactions.
In future it may be augmented or replaced by [cardano-graphql][cardano-graphql], but cardano-explorer-api will be supported for some time, even once alternatives become available.
